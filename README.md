# untouched-fingerprint-processing

**environment**: matlab 2020a

To run the project, simply run **main.m** to process the photo of untouched fingerprint using the SIFT algorithm or use the MCC algorithm referring to **MCC_main.m**.

If you want to process your own fingerprint, please put your image in the fold **img** and edit the path of the function **imread** to your own image, then run **main.m** or your **MCC_main.m** to see the result.
